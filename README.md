# Global Layoffs Data Cleaning & Analysis (SQL Project)

This project explores a global layoffs dataset to uncover workforce trends across industries, companies, and funding stages. 
It demonstrates SQL skills in **data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using MySQL.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning**: remove duplicates, standardize text fields, handle null values, and reformat dates.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: identify layoff trends by industry, company, country, and year.  
- Apply **SQL window functions and aggregate queries** to generate actionable insights.  

---

## üìä Dataset
- Source: `layoffs.csv`  
- Contains company-level layoff data with fields such as:
  - Company, Location, Industry, Date, Country, Stage, Funds Raised, Total Laid Off, % Laid Off
- Size: ~X rows, X columns (fill in after checking the CSV).
